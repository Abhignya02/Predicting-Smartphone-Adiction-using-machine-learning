# Predicting-Smartphone-Adiction-using-machine-learning
Smartphone addiction poses serious challenges to mental health, productivity, and social connections in today's digital era. The project "Predicting Smartphone Addiction Through Machine Learning" analyzes behavioral, psychological, and usage patterns—such as screen time, app usage, and surveys—using machine learning to classify addiction risk as Low, Moderate, or High. It also offers practical advice to reduce dependency, like setting screen time limits. Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system ensures seamless interaction, promoting awareness and healthier digital habits through the integration of technology and psychology.
